        An essential concept for developers is version control. Version control is a relatively simple concept focused on a single concept of tracking changes to a file. There benifits to version control are numerous:
  </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Reverting back to a previous version<br />
            There are many instances where one might want to revert back to a previous version. If a mistake is made with the code, it might be easier to revert to an older version. This also encourages experimentation with code. Changes can be made to a file with no ramifications to the project.</li>
            <li>Allowing others to work on the same file<br />
            Utilizing version control can help with multiple people working on the same project. When a new version is added, the developer working on it can add a note about what changes were added.</li>
            <li>Tracking progress of a project <br />
            Tracking progress can help for a few reasons. First it can help with accountability in that it can show who made what changes and when. If the project is open sourced, it can also provide more visability to the community it is serving.</li>
        </ol>

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
In this document we used the header, nav, body, article, and section tags. These tags setup the basic hierarchy for an html page and make it easier to read the code and translate our layout into the structure.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
The elements get laid out on a page in the order in which you write them and the browser uses this order to display those elements. So it is important for you to write in a sequential order for your audience and other developers to read your code.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned about sublime snippets and customization in this challenge. I do plan on creating more snippets in the future for skeletal structures that I will be using often. Another Snippet I found that would be useful is the Lorem Ipsum snippet when mocking up web pages.
