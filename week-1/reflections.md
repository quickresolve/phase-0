#These are my reflections for DBC WK-1

##1.1 Think About Time Reflection

Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?

The time management and productivity ideas that I learned about include The Pomodoro Technique, The Fogg Method, How to harness and stay in the “Flow”, learning to take the perspective of accomplishing small tasks in shorter periods of time to increase overall productivity, and apply meditation to ease anxiety, gain focus, and creativity.


What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?

A timebox is a previously agreed period of time during which a person or a team works steadily towards completion of some goal. Rather than allow work to continue until the goal is reached, and evaluating the time taken, the timebox approach consists of stopping work when the time limit is reached and evaluating what was accomplished.

In Phase 0, time boxing would be helpful in breaking up our weekly assignments in shorter chunks that are more easily accomplished in an hour or two so that we are steadily working throughout the weekly, practicing coding daily, and not procrastinating till the day before the work is due to finish.

How do you manage your time currently?

Currently, I do practice a form of time boxing but I do not usually give myself enough breaks in between my work to move around or relax my mind, which would probably lead to greater productivity.

Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?

My current strategy does work to get things done, but I would like to learn to work smarter instead of harder so that I have more time to relax and find work/life balance. Using these techniques should increase my efficiency and productivity overall.

Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?

Yes, I will employ the meditation techniques as well as time crunching with more frequent shorter breaks by blocking out my calendar with dedicated time for working, exercise, meditating, eating, relaxing, and fun.

What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?

My overall plan for Phase 0 time management is to strive for balance, increased productivity & efficiency by focusing on smaller tasks to achieve my overall goals in smaller spurts throughout each week.



##1.2 The Command Line Reflection


What is a shell? What is "bash?"

A shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation.

Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. Released in 1989, it has been distributed widely as the shell for the GNU operating system and as a default shell on Linux and OS X.

What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

The most challenging thing for me in going through this material was taking the time to repeat the same command over and over again to build muscle memory.

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

I was able to successfully use all of the commands.

In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

In my opinion the most important commands and arguments to know are help, pwd, cd, & touch. With these you will always know where you are, what is available to you to use, and you have the ability to create and manipulate files.

Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

-pwd - print working directory
-ls - list directory
-mv - move a file or directory
-cd - change directory
-../ - lists the path you are in
-touch - create new empty file, along with other options:
  a, change the access time only
  c, if the file does not exist, do not create it
  d, update the access and modification times
  m, change the modification time only
  r, use the access and modification times of file
  t, creates a file using a specified time
-mkdir - make directory
-less - page through a file
-rmdir - remove directory
-rm - remove files
-help - prints help information and other available commands
