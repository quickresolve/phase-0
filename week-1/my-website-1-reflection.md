Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

On your GitHub profile page click the (+) button on the top right hand side. Type a new repository name, description, select whether you want it to be public or private, add a license, and click the create repository button.

Describe what open source means.

Open source software (sometimes called Free and Open Source Software or FOSS) is the practice of sharing how a computer program was made and allowing anyone to customize the program as they see fit.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think Open Source is a great idea, that allows for an exponential evolution of technology. In a utopian situation, people would use open source to further creativity, fix, and add to code for the betterment of everyone. Open source does allow for the potential of others to steal code and repurpose it for their own benefit but licensing puts some protections in place to prevent that.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

Open source licenses allow software to be freely used, modified, and shared. When you license your work, youâ€™re not giving away any of your rights. You still hold the original copyright (or patent if you have one) on that work. What a license does is grant specific permissions for others to use that work.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

This challenge helped to reinforce the git version control workflow by repeating the steps over and over to branch, create files/changes, stage them, commit them, and the ability to see and track your process locally in your terminal, remotely on GitHub, and on your new web page at github.io.
