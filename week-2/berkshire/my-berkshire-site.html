                Reflections

- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

Translating the previous work with HTML into an actual site gave me a better visual representation of what was happening when I apply the html code elements to a page. Seeing the sections laid out together also reinforced the concepts in my mind so that I could have a better concrete understanding of a webpage’s framework.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

Researching and using semantic HTML5 elements over standard div elements allows for more readability and understanding of how a web page is structured. It will allow for others inspecting my code to understand it more easily. It also makes the transition from a wireframe to code more conceptually easy.


- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

It was tempting to start adding formatting to the HTML so that my page would more closely resemble the Berkshire page. I even added the formatting to see what it would look like and then removed it so that I can see the difference in usability and ease in adding the formatting in CSS later.


- What seems good and bad about HTML?

I appreciate that HTML allows for simple divisions of your web page into sections. Learning and remembering HTMLs semantic elements is easy because they are very intuitive and easy to use. It is easy to forget to close tags which can lead to frustration once you’re viewing your page on the browser and have to go back through and review all of your code to find the missing link.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I have been using flashcards and a handy cheat sheet in the interim til I have enough experience with all the elements to recall them from memory with ease.
