##Reflections

1. What is a wireframe?

>A website wireframe, also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint, is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website. Allows you to define the information hierarchy of your design, making it easier for you to plan the layout according to how you want your user to process the information.

2. What are the benefits of wireframing?

>Wireframing allows you or your design to:
  -Test and refine navigation
  -See how content lays out on the page
  -Study and rapidly refine the user interface design of web forms and interactive elements
  -Evaluate overall effectiveness of the page layout against usability best practices
  -Determine web development/programming requirements

3. Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

>I enjoyed wireframing very much. Wireframing by hand and then again online using several tools felt very creative and helped to cement the structure and layout of the page in my mind.

4. Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

>I kept the original design when I was wireframing with minor adjustments to give it a more basic structure. My hand drawn designs were a bit too detailed for this level.

5. What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

>I asked a lot of reflective questions on how I would like my online persona to be displayed, what kind of target audience I wanted to appeal to, how I could translate my hierarchy of information into a visual structure, what would be the best design layout for my users when navigating my site. I did a lot of research on others blogs to use as points of reference and compare layouts and features to what I had in mind for my own site.

6. Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

>I really enjoyed wireframing the most while going through the git command line process is probably still the most tedious task, I can appreciate its usefulness and choose not to focus on the repetition any longer.
