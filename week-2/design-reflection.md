#2.3 Introduction to Design and Site Planning


##Reflections

1. What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

+Information Gathering

>Consider the Purpose, Goals, Target Audience, & Content.

+Planning

>This is the point where a site map is developed. This serves as a guide as to what content will be on the site, and is essential to developing a consistent, easy to understand navigational system.

+Design

>Target audience is one of the key factors taken into consideration. As part of the design phase, it is also important to incorporate elements such as the company logo or colors to help strengthen the identity of your company on the web site.
Create one or more prototype designs for your web site. This is typically a .jpg image of what the final design will look like.

+Development

>The developmental stage is the point where the web site itself is created. Take all of the individual graphic elements from the prototype and use them to create the actual, functional site.

>This is typically done by first developing the home page, followed by a “shell” for the interior pages. The shell serves as a template for the content pages of your site, as it contains the main navigational structure for the web site.

+Testing and Delivery

>Test things such as the complete functionality of forms or other scripts, as well last testing for last minute compatibility issues (viewing differences between different web browsers), ensuring that your web site is optimized to be viewed properly in the most recent browser versions.

>A good web designer is one who is well versed in current standards for web site design and development. The basic technologies currently used are HTML and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Validate the code so that your site meets the current web development standards.

>An FTP (File Transfer Protocol) program is used to upload the web site files to your server. Some web designers offer domain name registration and web hosting services. Once these accounts have been setup, and your web site uploaded to the server, the site should be put through one last run-through. This is just precautionary, to confirm that all files have been uploaded correctly, and that the site continues to be fully functional.

+Maintenance

>Update the information on your web site. Many designers offer maintenance packages at reduced rates, based on how often you anticipate making changes or additions to your web site.

2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

>The primary goal and purpose of my page is to highlight my experience and knowledge as a Software Engineer/Web Developer. In order to accomplish this I will focus on my portfolio and blog so that future employers or clients can see my past work, experience, style, and know how.

3. What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

>My target audience’s interests will be creative and efficient web design, user experience, and technological advances in the field. I would also like to focus on my experience in the industry as a female born minority in the an industry that is predominantly privileged, white, and male. My site will address these issues through my writing, the apps that I design & develop, and the research and techniques that I share with them.

4. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

>I expect my target audience to learn from my experience and thus will be on my site to read my writing and follow my example. My portfolio and contact information will be available in order to provide reference to my experience and knowledge in the industry.

>What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
The main things someone should know about design and user experience is that it is a problem solving process and will be different depending on the goals of the owner of the site in order to appeal to their audience. Also, designing for UX can be a timely and costly process but is worthwhile in order to achieve a successful end result.

5. What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

>User experience (abbreviated as UX) is how a person feels when interfacing with a system. Websites have become so complex and feature-rich that, to be effective, they must have great user experience designs.  It is valuable because it will take into account cross platform usability, accessibility features, and the demand for efficiency while providing feature rich designs.

>Usability is big part of the user experience and plays a major role in experiences that are effective and pleasant, but then human factors science, psychology, information architecture and user-centered design principles also play major roles.

6. Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

>This challenge has actually been fun and productive for me instead of tedious. I have gained a greater vocabulary for UX design, while also being exposed to tools and features that I wasn’t aware of previously. After doing the research, creating a sitemap and accounting for what my target audience would want to see I am more confident in the product that I will be able to provide for them and future clients.
