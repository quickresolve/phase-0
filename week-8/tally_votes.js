// Pseudocode
/*
You will be provided with three JavaScript objects: votes, voteCount, and officers.
Your task is to go through votes and record each student's votes in voteCount. Once the votes have been tallied, assign the winners in officers.

Steps -
1) Create variable called Votecount that record's each student's votes
-iterate over votes object and for each object in votes iterate over the ballot and record the value of the position.
-use dot notation to add values to votecount

2)tally the votes and assign them into officers variable
-iterate over the votecount object and find the number of times a candidate has been selected then sum
-compare the candidates to see who was selected the most
-add winners to officers object
